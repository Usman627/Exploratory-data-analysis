# Exploratory-data-analysis
In this repository, I have collected data on various coaster rides and performed in-depth exploratory data analysis using popular Python libraries 
such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

This repository includes detailed code snippets and visualizations created using matplotlib and seaborn, 
allowing us to better understand the relationships between different elements of the coaster rides. 
I also created heatmaps and correlation plots to gain further insights into the data.

In addition, I ran several queries to uncover patterns and trends in the data, giving us a comprehensive understanding of the coaster ride characteristics.
